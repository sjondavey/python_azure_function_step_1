# python_azure_function_step_1

The idea is to start with [Microsoft's beginner tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/tutorial-vs-code-serverless-python-01), take an existing project (this project) and use this to create an Azure native, serverless calculator using Azure Functions and Azure Blob Storage to perform Monte Carlo simulation and persist the simulated values for later (xVA type) analysis.

Here I use Python 3 and develop in VSCode. Since I'm a noob, I'm documenting all the stuff I have to google to get up and running. This is here to ensure a common starting point, a python project, with a reasonable project structure, tested in VSCode. That's all. If you can run the tests here from within VSCode, you can move to the next step. One word of caution, I test that functions return exact 'float' values. This is not a good idea in general (perhaps different architectures or versions will have slightly different values) but I wanted to have something that was absolutely precise for me. If your tests fail at the nth decimal, just change the tests expected results!

Step 1 contains no Azure, it is here as an example of an existing project (code base) that we will gradually evolve into an Azure native, serverless calculator using Azure Functions and Azure Blob Storage to perform Monte Carlo simulation and persist the simulated values for later (xVA type) analysis.

Target Project Structure (NB Azure Functions stuff at this point)

```

### The virtual environment 
Virtual environments are required to ensure Azure can recreate a suitable environnement for the function
```python
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip list                           # in case you are interested to see the packages in the virtual environment
pip freeze > requirements.txt      # create the file with installed packages
```
If you want to use the `requirements.txt` from this project, the commands are 
```python
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Use the virtual environnement in VSCode 
[It is worth reading Microsoft's document](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments) if you have not already done so. The trick is to ensure you have the last two lines of this `launch.json` file. The default version of this file created in the Microsoft document does not have this because it is not using the project structure I'm using.
```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Current File",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "env": {"PYTHONPATH": "${workspaceRoot}"},
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
        }
    ]
}
```
### Setting up VSCode for testing
I use unittest. [Microsoft has a document](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing) well worth reading if you have not done so already.

From VSCode `Ctrl+Shft+P` and select `Python: Configure Tests`. I use `unittest Standard test framework`. The default setup of `settings.json` does not need to be changed.

Hopefully that is all you need to run the tests in VSCode (assuming obviously you have Python extension installed. I also use Pylance for linting)
